# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-minimum-value/'>1102. Path With Maximum Minimum Value</a>

## Problem
Given a matrix of integers A with R rows and C columns, find the maximum score of a path starting at [0,0] and ending at [R-1,C-1].

The score of a path is the minimum value in that path.  For example, the value of the path 8 →  4 →  5 →  9 is 4.

A path moves some number of times from one visited cell to any neighbouring unvisited cell in one of the 4 cardinal directions (north, east, west, south).

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

```
Input: [[5,4,5],[1,2,6],[7,4,6]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The path with the maximum score is highlighted in yellow. 
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>

```
Input: [[2,2,1,2,2,2],[1,2,2,2,1,2]]
Output: 2
```
<strong>Example 3:</strong>

<img src='https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/23/1313_ex3.JPG'>

```
Input: [[3,4,6,3,4],[0,2,1,1,7],[8,8,3,2,7],[3,2,4,9,8],[4,1,2,0,0],[4,6,5,4,3]]
Output: 3
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- 1 <= R, C <= 100
- 0 <= A[i][j] <= 10^9

## Solution
- Approach #1: PriorityQueue
Find the min value of the path which has value as large as possible
```
    public int maximumMinimumPath(int[][] A) {
        if (A.length == 0) return 0;
        int m = A.length, n = A[0].length;
        int maxScore = A[0][0];
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (b[0] - a[0]));
        pq.add(new int[] {A[0][0], 0, 0});
        int[][] dirs = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cur = pq.poll();
            maxScore = Math.min(maxScore, cur[0]);
            if (cur[1] == m - 1 && cur[2] == n - 1) return maxScore;
            A[cur[1]][cur[2]] = -1;
            for (int[] dir: dirs) {
                int nx = cur[1] + dir[0], ny = cur[2] + dir[1];
                if (0 <= nx && nx < m && 0 <= ny && ny < n && A[nx][ny] >= 0) {
                    pq.add(new int[] {A[nx][ny], nx, ny});
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
```
