# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/'>69. Sqrt(x)</a>

## Problem
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Solution
- Approach #1: Binary Search. ```Time O(logn)```
```
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0 || x == 1) {
            return x;
        }
        int left = 0, right = x / 2 + 1;
        while (left < right) {
            // Notice: long -> avoid overflow, + 1 -> shift to left
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2 + 1;
            if (mid * mid > x) {
                right = (int) mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = (int) mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
```

- Approach #2: Newton

```
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        long r = x;
        while (r*r > x)
            r = (r + x/r) / 2;
        return (int) r;
    }
```
