# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/'>485. Max Consecutive Ones</a>

## Problem
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
- The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

## Solution
- Approach #1: One pass. ```Time O(N)```
```
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, count);
        }
        return max;
    }
```
