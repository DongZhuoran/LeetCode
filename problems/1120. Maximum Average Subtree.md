# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subtree/'>1120. Maximum Average Subtree</a>

## Problem
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

```
Input: [5,6,1]
Output: 6.00000
Explanation: 
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.
``` 

<strong>Note:</strong>
- The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 5000.
- Each node will have a value between 0 and 100000.
- Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.

## Solution
- Approach #1: Recursion. ```Time O(N)```
```
    double maxVal = 0.0;
    public double maximumAverageSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return maxVal;
    }
    
    private int[] dfs(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return new int[] {0, 0};
        int[] left = dfs(root.left);
        int[] right = dfs(root.right);
        int[] ret = new int[] {left[0] + right[0] + root.val, left[1] + right[1] + 1};
        maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, ret[0] / (double) ret[1]);
        return ret;
    }
```
