# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/'>451. Sort Characters By Frequency</a>

## Problem
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```
<strong>Example 3:</strong>
```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

## Solution
- Approach #1: HashMap + bucket sort. ```Time O(N)```
```
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c: s.toCharArray())
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        
        List<Character>[] buckets = new ArrayList[s.length() + 1];
        for (char k: map.keySet()) {
            int freq = map.get(k);
            if (buckets[freq] == null) buckets[freq] = new ArrayList<>();
            buckets[freq].add(k);
        }
        
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        for (int pos = buckets.length - 1; pos >= 0; -- pos) {
            if (buckets[pos] != null) {
                for (char c: buckets[pos]) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < map.get(c); ++ i)
                        res.append(c);
                }
            }
        }
        return res.toString();
    }
```
