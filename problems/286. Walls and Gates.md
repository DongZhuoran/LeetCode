# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/walls-and-gates/'>286. Walls and Gates</a>

## Problem
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

1. -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
2. 0 - A gate.
3. INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

<strong>Example:</strong> 
Given the 2D grid:
```
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
```
After running your function, the 2D grid should be:
```
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```

## Solution
- Approach #1: BFS. ```Time O(n)```
```
    public void wallsAndGates(int[][] rooms) {
        if (rooms.length == 0) return;
        
        int[][] dirs = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
        Queue<int[]> queue = addSources(rooms);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cur = queue.poll();
            for (int[] dir: dirs) {
                int nx = cur[0] + dir[0], ny = cur[1] + dir[1];
                if (nx < 0 || nx >= rooms.length || ny < 0 || ny >= rooms[0].length || rooms[nx][ny] == -1 || rooms[nx][ny] <= rooms[cur[0]][cur[1]] + 1) continue;
                rooms[nx][ny] = rooms[cur[0]][cur[1]] + 1;
                queue.add(new int[] {nx, ny});
            }
        }
    }
    
    private Queue<int[]> addSources(int[][] rooms) {
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < rooms.length; ++ i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < rooms[0].length; ++ j) {
                if (rooms[i][j] == 0) queue.add(new int[] {i, j});
            }
        }
        return queue;
    }
```
