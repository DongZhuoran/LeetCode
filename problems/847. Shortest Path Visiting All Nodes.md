# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes/'>847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes</a>

## Problem
An undirected, connected graph of N nodes (labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1) is given as graph.

graph.length = N, and j != i is in the list graph[i] exactly once, if and only if nodes i and j are connected.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- 1 <= graph.length <= 12
- 0 <= graph[i].length < graph.length

## Solution
- Approach #1: BFS ```Time O(2^N * N) Space (2^N * N)```
```
    public int shortestPathLength(int[][] graph) {
        int N = graph.length;
        Queue<State> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int[][] dist = new int[1 << N][N];
        for (int[] row: dist) Arrays.fill(row, N * N);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++ i) {
            queue.add(new State(1 << i, i));
            dist[1 << i][i] = 0;
        }
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            State cur = queue.poll();
            if (cur.cover == (1 << N) - 1) return dist[cur.cover][cur.head];
            for (int nei: graph[cur.head]) {
                int cover = cur.cover | 1 << nei;
                if (dist[cur.cover][cur.head] + 1 < dist[cover][nei]) {
                    dist[cover][nei] = dist[cur.cover][cur.head] + 1;
                    queue.add(new State(cover, nei));
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    class State {
        int cover;
        int head;
        public State(int c, int h) {
            cover = c;
            head = h;
        }
    }
```
