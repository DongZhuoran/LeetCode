## Problem
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Solution
- Approach #1: dp. Time/Space->O(mn)
```
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length(), n = word2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++ i) dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++ j) dp[0][j] = j;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++ i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++ j) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1))
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
```
