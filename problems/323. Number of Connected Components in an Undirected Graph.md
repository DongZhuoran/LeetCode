# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/'>323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph</a>

## Problem
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4 

Output: 2
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output:  1
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

## Solution
- Approach #1: Union-find.
```
    int[] parent;
    public int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        if (n <= 0) return 0;
        
        parent = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++ i) parent[i] = i;
        
        int count = n;
        for (int[] edge: edges) {
            if (union(edge[0], edge[1])) {
                count --;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x)
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }
    
    public boolean union(int x, int y) {
        int px = find(x), py = find(y);
        if (px == py) return false;
        parent[py] = px;
        return true;
    }
```
