# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/'>957. Prison Cells After N Days</a>

## Problem
There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- cells.length == 8
- cells[i] is in {0, 1}
- 1 <= N <= 10^9

## Solution
- Approach #1: Simulation. ```Time O(2^N) -> TLE```
```
    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        if (N <= 0) return cells;
        
        int[] cells2 = new int[8];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++ i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < 7; ++ j) {
                cells2[j] = 1 - (cells[j - 1] ^ cells[j + 1]);
            }
            cells = cells2;
            cells2 = new int[8];
        }
        return cells;
    }
```

- Approach #2: Math. ```Time O(1)```

Explanation: https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/discuss/205684/JavaPython-Find-the-Loop-or-Mod-14
```
    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        for (N = (N - 1) % 14 + 1; N > 0; --N) {
            int[] cells2 = new int[8];
            for (int i = 1; i < 7; ++i)
                cells2[i] = cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1] ? 1 : 0;
            cells = cells2;
        }
        return cells;
    }
```
