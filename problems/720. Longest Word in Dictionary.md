# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/'>720. Longest Word in Dictionary</a>

## Problem
Given a list of strings words representing an English Dictionary, find the longest word in words that can be built one
character at a time by other words in words. If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the 
smallest lexicographical order.

If there is no answer, return the empty string.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: 
words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: 
The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
```
<strong>Example 2:<strong>
```
Input: 
words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: 
Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
- The length of words will be in the range [1, 1000].
- The length of words[i] will be in the range [1, 30].

## Solution
- Approach #1: Trie + DFS
```
    public String longestWord(String[] words) {
        Trie trie = new Trie();
        int index = 0;
        for (String w: words)
            trie.insert(w, ++index);
        trie.words = words;
        return trie.dfs();
    }
    
    class Node {
        char c;
        Map<Character, Node> children = new HashMap<>();
        int end;
        public Node(char c) {
            this.c = c;
        }
    }
    
    class Trie {
        Node root;
        String[] words;
        public Trie() {
            root = new Node('0');
        }
        
        public void insert(String word, int index) {
            Node cur = root;
            for (char c: word.toCharArray()) {
                cur.children.putIfAbsent(c, new Node(c));
                cur = cur.children.get(c);
            }
            cur.end = index;
        }
        
        public String dfs() {
            String res = "";
            Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();
            stack.push(root);
            while (!stack.empty()) {
                Node cur = stack.pop();
                if (cur.end > 0 || cur == root) {
                    if (cur.end > 0) {
                        String word = words[cur.end - 1];
                        if (res.length() < word.length() || 
                            res.length() == word.length() && word.compareTo(res) < 0) 
                            res = word;
                    }
                    for (Node nei: cur.children.values())
                        stack.push(nei);
                }
            }
            return res;
        }
    }
```
