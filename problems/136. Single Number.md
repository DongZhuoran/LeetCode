# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/'>136. Single Number</a>

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

<strong>Note:</strong>
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
## Solution
- Approach #1: XOR. ```Time O(n)```
```
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int n: nums) {
            res ^= n;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
