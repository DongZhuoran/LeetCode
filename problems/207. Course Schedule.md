# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/'>207. Course Schedule</a>

## Problem
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.


## Solution
- Approach #1: Indegree. ```Time O(N)```
```
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        int[][] pre = new int[numCourses][numCourses];
        int[] indegrees = new int[numCourses];
        for (int[] p: prerequisites) {
            if (pre[p[0]][p[1]] == 0) {
                indegrees[p[1]]++;
            }
            pre[p[0]][p[1]] = 1;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (indegrees[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
        }
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int c = queue.poll();
            count++;
            for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
                if (pre[c][i] == 1) {
                    if (--indegrees[i] == 0) {
                        queue.offer(i);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count == numCourses;
    }
```

- Approach #2: DFS.
```
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {        
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++ i)
            graph.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; ++i) {
            int course = prerequisites[i][0];
            int prerequisite = prerequisites[i][1];            
            graph.get(course).add(prerequisite);
        }
        
        int[] visited = new int[numCourses];
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++ i)
            if (!dfs(i, graph, visited)) return false;
        
        return true;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(int curr, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph, int[] visited) {
        if (visited[curr] == 1) return false;
        if (visited[curr] == 2) return true;
        
        visited[curr] = 1;
                
        for (int nei : graph.get(curr))
            if (!dfs(nei, graph, visited)) return false;
        
        visited[curr] = 2;
        return true;
    }
```
