# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/'>717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters</a>

## Problem
We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- 1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
- bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

## Solution
- Approach #1: Greedy. ```Time O(N) Space O(1)```
```
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        if (bits.length == 1) return true;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < bits.length) {
            if (i == bits.length - 1) return true;
            if (bits[i] == 0) i ++;
            else i += 2;
        }
        return false;
    }
```
