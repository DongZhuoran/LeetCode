# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/'>343. Integer Break</a>

## Problem
Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. 
Return the maximum product you can get.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
```

<strong>Note:</strong> You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

## Solution
- Approach #1: Math. ```Time O(N)```
If an optimal product contains a factor f >= 4, then you can replace it with factors 2 and f-2 without losing optimality, 
as 2*(f-2) = 2f-4 >= f. So you never need a factor greater than or equal to 4, meaning you only need factors 1, 2 and 3 
(and 1 is of course wasteful and you'd only use it for n=2 and n=3, where it's needed). 3*3 is simply better than 2*2*2, 
so you'd never use 2 more than twice.
```
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        if (n == 3) return 2;
        int res = 1;
        while (n > 4) {
            res *= 3;
            n -= 3;
        }
        res *= n;
        return res;
    }
```

- Approach #2: DP ```Time O(N^2)```
```
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i ++) {
            for(int j = 1; j < i; j ++) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], (Math.max(j,dp[j])) * (Math.max(i - j, dp[i - j])));
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
```
