## Problem
Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.
Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s.  

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- 1 <= A.length <= 20000
- 0 <= K <= A.length
- A[i] is 0 or 1 

## Solution
- Approach #1: Sliding window with Queue. ```Time O(N) Space O(N)```
This is for stream input, see <a href='https://github.com/DongZhuoran/LeetCode/blob/master/problems/487.%20Max%20Consecutive%20Ones%20II.md'>Max Consecutive Ones II</a>
```
    class Solution {
        public int longestOnes(int[] A, int K) {
            int max = 0;
            Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
            for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < A.length; ++ r) {
                if (A[r] == 0)
                    q.offer(r);
                if (q.size() > K)
                    l = q.poll() + 1;
                max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
            }
            return max;
        }
    }
```

- Approach #2: Sliding window. ```Time O(N) Space O(1)```
```
    class Solution {
        public int longestOnes(int[] A, int K) {
            int max = 0;
            int zero = 0;
            for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < A.length; ++ r) {
                if (A[r] == 0) zero ++;
                while (zero > K) {
                    if (A[l ++] == 0)
                        zero --;
                }
                max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
            }
            return max;
        }
    }
```
