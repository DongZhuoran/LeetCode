# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/'>138. Copy List with Random Pointer</a>

## Problem
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a ```deep copy``` of the list.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
<img src='https://assets.leetcode.com/static_assets/discuss/uploads/files/1470150906153-2yxeznm.png' alt='ex pic'>
```
<strong>Input:</strong>
{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
``` 

<strong>Note:</strong>
- You must return the copy of the given head as a reference to the cloned list.

Definition for singly-linked list with a random pointer.
```
 class RandomListNode {
     int label;
     RandomListNode next, random;
     RandomListNode(int x) { this.label = x; }
 };
```

## Solution
- Approach #1: HashMap. ```Time O(N) Space O(N)``` 
```
    public RandomListNode copyRandomList(RandomListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        Map<RandomListNode, RandomListNode> hm = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Round 1: copy all the nodes and keep in hashmap.
        RandomListNode cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            hm.put(cur, new RandomListNode(cur.label));
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        
        // Round 2: traverse the source linked list, extract corresponding nodes.
        cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            RandomListNode cNode = hm.get(cur);
            cNode.next = hm.get(cur.next);
            cNode.random = hm.get(cur.random);
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        return hm.get(head);
    }
```
