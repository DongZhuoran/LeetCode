# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/'>138. Copy List with Random Pointer</a>

## Problem
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a ```deep copy``` of the list.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
<img src='https://assets.leetcode.com/static_assets/discuss/uploads/files/1470150906153-2yxeznm.png' alt='ex pic'>
```
<strong>Input:</strong>
{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
``` 

<strong>Note:</strong>
- You must return the copy of the given head as a reference to the cloned list.

Definition for singly-linked list with a random pointer.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node next;
    public Node random;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _next,Node _random) {
        val = _val;
        next = _next;
        random = _random;
    }
};
```

## Solution
- Approach #1: HashMap. ```Time O(N) Space O(N)``` 
```
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return head;
        Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Round 1: copy all the nodes and keep in hashmap.
        Node cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            map.put(cur, new Node(cur.val, null, null));
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        
        // Round 2: traverse the source linked list, extract corresponding nodes.
        cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            Node node = map.get(cur);
            node.next = map.get(cur.next);
            node.random = map.get(cur.random);
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        return map.get(head);
    }
```

- Approach #2: Iterative. ```Time O(N) Space O(1)```
```
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        Node cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            Node node = new Node(cur.val);
            node.next = cur.next;
            cur.next = node;
            cur = node.next;
        }
        
        cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            cur.next.random = (cur.random != null) ? cur.random.next : null;
            cur = cur.next.next;
        }
        
        Node old = head;
        Node now = head.next;
        Node nowHead = head.next;
        while (old != null) {
            old.next = old.next.next;
            now.next = now.next != null ? now.next.next : null;
            old = old.next;
            now = now.next;
        }
        return nowHead;
    }
```
