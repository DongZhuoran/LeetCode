# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/connecting-cities-with-minimum-cost/'>1135. Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost</a>

## Problem
There are N cities numbered from 1 to N.

You are given connections, where each connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect city1 and city2 together.  (A connection is bidirectional: connecting city1 and city2 is the same as connecting city2 and city1.)

Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together.  The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

<img src='https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/20/1314_ex2.png'>

```
Input: N = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>

<img src='https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/20/1314_ex1.png'>

```
Input: N = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- 1 <= N <= 10000
- 1 <= connections.length <= 10000
- 1 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= N
- 0 <= connections[i][2] <= 10^5
- connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]

## Solution
- Approach #1: Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm with Union Find
```
    int[] parent;
    int n;
    public int minimumCost(int N, int[][] connections) {
        parent = new int[N + 1];
        n = N;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++ i)
            parent[i] = i;
        
        Arrays.sort(connections, (a, b) -> (a[2] - b[2]));
        int res = 0;
        for (int[] c: connections) {
            if (find(c[0]) != find(c[1])) {
                union(c[0], c[1]);
                n --;
                res += c[2];
            }
        }
        return n == 1 ? res : -1;
    }
    
    public void union(int x, int y) {
        int px = find(x);
        int py = find(y);
        if (px != py) {
            parent[px] = py;
        }
    }
    
    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
```
