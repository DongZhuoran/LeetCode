# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-sticks/'>1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks</a>

## Problem
You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y.  You perform this action until 
there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way. 

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30
```

<strong>Constraints:</strong>
- 1 <= sticks.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4

## Solution
- Approach #1: Greedy. ```Time O(NlogNlogN)```
```
    public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) {
        int res = 0;
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int i: sticks)
            pq.add(i);
        
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int len1 = pq.poll();
            int len2 = pq.poll();
            int len3 = len1 + len2;
            res += len3;
            pq.add(len3);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
```
