# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/'>1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves</a>

## Problem
Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:
- The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
- The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d+1.
- The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: 
The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization "[1,2,3]".
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [4]
```
<strong>Example 3:</strong>
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [2,4,5]
```

<strong>Constraints:</strong>
- The given tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
- Each node of the tree will have a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
 
## Solution
- Approach #1: DFS. ```Time O(N)```
```
    TreeNode res = null;
    int maxDepth = 0;
    public TreeNode lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, 0);
        return res;
    }
    
    public int dfs(TreeNode node, int depth) {
        maxDepth = Math.max(maxDepth, depth);
        if (node == null) return depth;
        
        int left = dfs(node.left, depth + 1);
        int right = dfs(node.right, depth + 1);
        if (left == maxDepth && right == maxDepth)
            res = node;
        return Math.max(left, right);
    }
```
