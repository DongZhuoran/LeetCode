# <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/'>763. Partition Labels</a>

## Problem
A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

<strong>Note:</strong>
- S will have length in range [1, 500].
- S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.

## Solution
- Approach #1: Greedy. ```Time O(N) Space O(N)```
```
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String S) {
        if (S.length() == 0) return null;
        
        int[] idx = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); ++ i) {
            idx[S.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i; 
        }
        
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int last = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); ++ i) {
            last = Math.max(last, idx[S.charAt(i) - 'a']);
            count ++;
            if (i == last) {
                res.add(count);
                last = 0;
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
